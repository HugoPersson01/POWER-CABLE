# How to use the UserInterface that is implemented in our code:
## Step 1: "Start the program"

> This is how it should look after starting the program

## Step 2: "Calibrate the machine"

> You calibrate the machine by pressing the "calibrate button" shown in the left picture.
> When the calibration is in progress the motor will start rotating inwards and then outwards,
> you can see this in the right picture. Notis the red line going down and then up again, which translates
> to the inward and outward movement of the cord.
>
> This is the first instence of you seeing a red line and a blue "line". As can be read in the graph window, the red line represents
> the positioning of the cord. if you pull out the cord the red line will go up and if you release the cord the red line will go down.
> The blue line represents the current weight the motor is applying. These two lines will give the user realtime information no other
> training equpment shows.
