# How to use the UserInterface that is implemented in our code:
> ##### In the pictures that will be shown bellow "buttons" and "checkboxes" that is used in the part im explaining will be highlighted in a light blue color to show what buttons to press to 
## Step 1: "Start the program"

> This is how it should look after starting the program

## Step 2: "Calibrate the machine"

> You calibrate the machine by pressing the "calibrate button" shown in the left picture.
> When the calibration is in progress the motor will start rotating inwards and then outwards,
> you can see this in the right picture. Notis the red line going down and then up again, which translates
> to the inward and outward movement of the cord.
>
> This is the first instence of you seeing a red line and a blue "line". As can be read in the graph window, the red line represents
> the positioning of the cord. if you pull out the cord the red line will go up and if you release the cord the red line will go down.
> The blue line represents the current weight the motor is applying. These two lines will give the user realtime information no other
> training equpment shows.

## Step 2.1: "Clear errors"
> <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Clear-Errors.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/>
>
> If you calibrate the machine and notis that the calibration didnt go all the way through we will need to clear the errors and start the calibration process again. There could be several reasons why the calibration did'nt go through:
> + The first fix would be to make sure the cable has more room to move during the calibration progress.
> + Second fix would be to make sure all cables are well conacted to the encoder.
> + Third fix would be to close down the program and disconect the powersupply from the wall outlet, and waiting for a few seconds before reconacting the power.
> 
> After doing these controlls press "clear all errors" shown in the picture above and do step 2 over again. 

## Step 4: "Turn-on/off"
> <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Turn-On.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/>
>
> You can turn the machine on and off when ever you want, you will nedd to turn it on after you have calibrtated the machine. When you press the "turn on/off" button it will toggle between being on and off. You can easily see if the machine is on or off by looking at the blue line. The picture above shows how it looks when you turn the machine of for the first time, the blue line starts going up and down, if it is flat the machine is off.
