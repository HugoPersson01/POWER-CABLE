### Step 2: "Calibrate the machine"
> | Calibrate button | Calibrate in progress |
> |:----------------:|:---------------------:|
> | <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Calibrate.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/> | <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Calibrate-In-Progress.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/> |
>
> To calibrate the machine, press the "Calibrate" button shown in the left picture.
> During calibration, the motor will start rotating, pulling the cord inwards and then outwards, as shown in the right picture.
> Notice the red line going down and then back up, this represents the inward and outward movement of the cord.
>
> This is the first instance where you will see a red line and a blue line.
> As indicated in the graph window, the red line represents the positioning of the cord.
> If you pull the cord out, the red line will rise, and if you release the cord, the red line will fall.
> The blue line represents the current weight the motor is applying.
> These two lines provide real-time information that no other training equipment offers.

### Step 3: "Clear errors"
> <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Clear-Errors.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/>
>
> If you calibrate the machine and notice that the calibration did not complete successfully, you will need to clear the errors and restart the calibration process.
> Several reasons may cause the calibration to fail:
> + First fix, ensure that the cable has enough room to move during the calibration process. If this doesn't work try next step.
> + Second fix, check that all cables are properly connected to the encoder, walloutlet or computer. If this also doesn't work try the final step.
> + Third fix, close the program and disconnect the power supply from the wall outlet. Wait for a few seconds before reconnecting the power.
> After performing these checks, press "Clear All Errors," as shown in the picture above, and repeat Step 2.

### Step 4: "Turn on/off"
> <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Turn-On.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/>
>
> You can turn the machine on and off whenever you want. You will need to turn it on after you have calibrated the machine.
> When you press the "turn on/off" button, it will toggle between being on and off.
> You can easily see if the machine is on or off by looking at the blue line.
> The picture above shows how it looks when you turn the machine on for the first time: the blue line starts off flat and then begins moving up and down.

### Step 5: "Set weight"
> | Chose weight | Set weight |
> |:------------:|:----------:|
> | <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Pick-Weight.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/> | <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Set-Weight.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/> |
> 
##### IMPORTANT:
> 
> The left picture above shows where you select the weight you want to use. We recommend starting with a low weight, around 5 kg,
> to make sure you don’t harm the machine or yourself when setting it up. Choose the weight you want to use during your workout when you're ready to start using the machine.
> The problems that can occur are:
> + If you change the length of the cord and make it shorter using the implemented functions (which will be described in step 6), the motor can quickly pull in the cord with a lot of force, 
> + which may cause the user to be pulled down if they are holding the cord while doing this.
> + So, as we mentioned, we recommend using a low weight and a short distance when setting up the machine before training. This will be covered in step 6, where we describe how to adjust the cord’s starting length.
> ##### [Back to top](#how-to-use-the-userinterface-that-is-implemented-in-our-code).
##


### Step 6: "Change cord length"
> <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/ChangeDistans.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/> 
>
##### IMPORTANT:
> 
> The picture above shows how you can change the reel in/out distance of the cord. This indicates how much the cord will reel in or out every time you press the '+' or '-' button; these buttons will be explained below.
> This is the distance I mentioned in step 5. A more detailed explanation of the potential harm the machine can cause to the user is as follows: if you reel in the cord, let's say by 10 cm, and have a heavy starting
> weight, the motor will pull in the cord with a force equal to the starting weight, and it will do so quickly. This can lead to the user being pulled down with sudden force, potentially causing injury. This issue may be
> addressed in a later version of our product; if so, this will be updated.
>
> | Reel in the cord | Unreel the cord |
> |:----------------:|:---------------:|
> | <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Decrease-cord.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/> | <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Extend-Cord.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/> |
>
> The left picture shows how you can reel in the cord. The cord will reel in by the amount of centimeters chosen by the user, as explained above. The right picture shows how you can unreel the cord; it works the same way as we just explained, but in the opposite direction.

### Step 7: "Sine Function"
> <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Sine-Set-Freq.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/>
> 
> The picture above shows you how to pick a frequancy that will be used to create the sine wave. The frequency 𝑓 tells you how many cycles of the wave occur per second (i.e., how often the wave repeats in one second). The period 𝑇 is the time it takes for the wave to complete one full cycle. Since frequency and
> period are inversely related, you can calculate the period by taking the reciprocal of the frequency, ( 𝑇 = 1 / 𝑓 ).
> + We recommend a low frequency of at least 0.25 Hz to achieve a period time of 4 seconds; this will ensure safe training.
> + If you want a slower sine curve, you just need to lower the frequency to around 0.20 Hz to achieve a period time of 5 seconds.
> 
> | Set min weight | Set max weight |
> |:--------------:|:--------------:|
> | <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Sine-Set-Min.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/> | <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Sine-Set-Max.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/> |
>
> The left picture shows you how to select a minimum weight. This will be the minimum value of the sine wave.
> The right picture shows you how to select the maximum weight. This will instead correlate to the maximum value of the sine wave.
>
> | Start sine wave function | Sine wave in use |
> |:------------------------:|:----------------:|
> | <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Start-Time-Sine.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/> | <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Running.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/> |
> 
>
> The left picture shows you how to start the sine wave function, and the right picture shows you how the graph will look when the sine wave function is in use.
> + The picture below explains the values (𝑇, min weight, max weight) used to create the sine wave.

### Step 8: "Linear function"
> <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Lin-Set-Max-Time.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/>
>
> The linear function works by increasing the weight in a linear manner from the starting weight to the stop weight over the time set by the user. You can compare this to a reverse "drop set" often used by people working out in gyms. The best part is that you don’t need to stop the workout to change weights, as you have to do in a regular gym.
> The picture above shows you how to select the maximum time this function will be in use; recommendations on what time you should use are explained below in the next pictures.
>
> | Start weight | Stop weight |
> |:------------:|:-----------:|
> | <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Lin-Set-Min-Kg.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/> | <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Lin-Set-Max-Kg.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/> |
>
> The left picture shows how to select the starting weight. We recommend starting with a manageable weight, like 1 to a maximum of 5 kg, to avoid injuries. The right picture shows how to set the stop weight. Again, we insist that you pick a weight you can manage to avoid injuring yourself.
> + Note: For the safe use of this function, we recommend, as mentioned above, that you select weights you can manage and also choose a maximum time that is safe. To ensure safety, we recommend a time at least double the maximum weight. This allows the weight to increase slowly and manageably over time. We do not recommend a time less than half of the maximum weight.
> + We use the equation y = kx + m where k is the magical value for a safe usage. You want a k value of 0.5, which you achieve by setting the maximum time to double the maximum weight
>

>
> The picture above shows you how to turn the function on. You can turn it off by pressing the same checkbox again.
> ##### [Back to top](#how-to-use-the-userinterface-that-is-implemented-in-our-code).

## Step 9: "Record function"
> <img src="https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/blob/main/Machine/Software/howto/Pictures/Start-Recording.png" alt="My Image" width="450" height="300"/>
>
> The picture above shows how to start the record function. The other functons like, positions, set weight and so on are nor yet implemented. This part will be updaten when they are done.
> During the recording you will get information about time, position and current weight. The data will be stored in a seprate file which can be opened to see the recorded data.
