# Power Cable: Weightles training equpment 
We are five students pursuing a degree in Medical Engineering at KTH in Stockholm, Sweden, currently in our third year of study. 

+ This product was part of a course we have called "Tehcology and Health, Project Course" where we get to invent/improve a product. 


## About the product:

Our product comprises two main components: hardware and software.

#### Hardware: 
+ Our product utilizes a motor (sourced from a motorized longboard, with future models planned to feature an ODrive motor) that strives to maintain its starting position. The force the motor uses to resist movement is determined by an equation in our Python code. This equation translates the desired weight into the current supplied to the motor. With this technology, users can work against the motor's resistance, allowing for workouts with weights of up to 100 kg without the need to purchase multiple weights.

#### Software:
+ To ensure our product functions effectively, we have developed Python code with an intuitive user interface that offers a range of features, including easy weight adjustments, workout recording, and access to various workout programs.
