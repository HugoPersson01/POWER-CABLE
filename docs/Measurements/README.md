These measurements were made using the `record` function in the Python code.

. Becides the `record`function we used a force gauge to get the real world data and not only the data the computer thinks we have. Here is the link for the force gauge we used ➔ [Force gauge](https://docs.rs-online.com/ebc3/A700000007226729.pdf).
 
The measurements were conducted during dynamic movements at varying paces.
> Despite the differences in pace, each movement was performed within the optimal time-per-rep range.
