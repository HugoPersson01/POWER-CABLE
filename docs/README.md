Here is the link for the force gauge we used ➔ [Force gauge](https://docs.rs-online.com/ebc3/A700000007226729.pdf).
+ After using the method we have described above we notised that the motor ends up in a idling mode, we ended up changing the method of executing our measuremtns by:
  + Doing slow and controlled movements up and down to ensure the idling dosn't hapen. This showed a better result in our data we recorded.
  + The data can be seen here  ➔ [Measurements](https://github.com/HugoPersson01/POWER-CABLE/tree/main/docs/Measurements).
