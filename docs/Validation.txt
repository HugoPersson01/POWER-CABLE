Validation
Validation of a product, process, or system means ensuring that it meets the standards, expectations, and requirements identified by customers and other stakeholders. It involves confirming that claims or statements about a product, service, or system align with reality. For example, if a manufacturer claims that a product contains 20 percent recycled plastic, validation can be used to check whether this statement is accurate.
Validation, like verification and certification, is a form of conformity assessment used to build trust among stakeholders. Organizations that perform validation and verification often follow international standards. An important standard used for this purpose is SS-EN ISO/IEC 17929:2019, which outlines general principles and requirements for validation and verification bodies.
The purpose of validation is to provide stakeholders with confidence that a claim, report, or forecast is correct and feasible. The benefit of validation could be, for example, ensuring that a machine can achieve a deviation of only 1 gram. To reach this level of precision, it must be validated that the tools, knowledge, and time available are sufficient to achieve the goal.
Here are some key reasons why validation is performed:
* Quality Assurance: Validation ensures that the product or system functions according to specified requirements and is free from errors. In our case, weight (reduced hysteresis)?
* Compliance with Standards: Validation is often required to meet legal or industry-specific standards and regulations.
* Risk Minimization: By validating early in a process, potential issues can be identified and addressed, reducing the risk of errors and costly measures later on. Finding a method that provides reliable results with minimal risk of error.
* Trust: Validation builds trust among users, customers, and other stakeholders that what has been validated is reliable and safe to use. In our case, ensuring that the stated weight is indeed what is being delivered. Within an acceptable range of ± 0.5 Kg
Other aspects can include customer satisfaction, efficiency, and cost savings. When a product or service is validated, it ensures that it meets customers' expectations and needs, leading to increased customer satisfaction. Through validation, unnecessary rework can be avoided, and processes can be improved, saving time and money.
